> It is about understanding system behavior early and protecting correctness as products scale.”


I am a QA Engineer with 4+ years of experience working in high-pressure startup and product environments, focused on building reliable, automation-driven quality systems for complex, workflow-heavy platforms.

My work centers on ensuring that business-critical systems behave correctly under real-world conditions particularly platforms driven by data, automation and AI-assisted decision logic.

## Current Focus

I work on B2B and AI-adjacent platforms where:

- Business workflows span multiple actors and systems  
- Data accuracy directly impacts downstream automation and intelligence  
- Failures are costly and often non-obvious  

At FoodBridge, I contribute to end-to-end QA for a supply-chain platform that connects sellers, buyers and partners, ensuring order, pricing, inventory and onboarding workflows remain stable as the system scales.

Previously, at Gaply, I automated the platform’s core AI gap analysis workflow.

## Approach to Quality Engineering

- Manual exploration to understand real user behavior  
- Decomposition of complex workflows into testable units  
- Selective automation for high-impact flows  
- Emphasis on data integrity  
- QA as a release gate
